# Binary Tree (BTree) Assignment

## Overview
This project implements a **Binary Search Tree (BST)** in Java to store and manage randomly generated car data. 
Each car is defined by a **color, year, make, and model**, and is stored in the tree using a **key derived from the car’s `hashCode()`**.

The project demonstrates fundamental binary tree operations, traversal logic, and analysis of tree structure.

---

## Functionality
The binary tree supports the following operations:

- Generate random car objects (color, year, make, model)
- Create a key for each car using `hashCode()`
- Add a data point to the binary tree
- Find a data point using its key
- Display stored car information
- Display the number of levels / visits during tree operations
- Delete a data point from the tree
- Display the highest key (maximum) and its visit / level count
- Display the lowest key (minimum) and its visit / level count
- Visualize the binary tree structure in the console

## Technologies Used
- Java  
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)  
- Binary Search Trees
- AI was used to make workflow smoother

---

## Purpose
This project is part of a coursework assignment focused on understanding **binary tree behavior, traversal efficiency, and data organization**, rather than production-level optimization.
